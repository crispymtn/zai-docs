# Scopes

::: warning
**This documentation is experimental and works only partially. If you have specific questions, please contact us.**
:::

Scopes are used to determine which permissions each client has for a defined subject. An authenticated person must grant these permissions either to an organisation or to themselves.
We therefore distinguish between two types of bearers in a Authorization token: `Organization` and `Person`. Scopes are used to identify the subject type for which the token is to be created.

Scopes can also be added to various audiences.

## Requested Scope Structure

This is the basic structure of a requested scope `BEARER_TYPE_AND_ID`.`AUDIENCE_NAME`.`SCOPE_NAME`.`PERMISSION`

### `BEARER_TYPE_AND_ID`

Can be omitted or be `Org` or `Per`. For the [client credentials flow](/guide/oauth/client-credentials.html) it is also required to provide the UUID of the Organisation or Person (e.g. `Org/b1475f65-236c-58b8-96e1-e1778b43beb7`).

### `AUDIENCE_NAME`

Defines for which app the permission should be granted. For example: `warehouse`.

### `SCOPE_NAME`

The scope name is provided by each app and is given by each app.

### `PERMISSION`

The type of permission that is requested. `r` stands for _read_ and `rw` for _read_write_.

### Regex

```regex
/^(((Org|Per)(\/[a-z0-9-]+)?)\.)?[a-z]{1}[a-z0-9_]{2,}\.[a-z]{1}[a-z_]{2,}\.(rw|r)/
```

### Valid requested scopes examples

| Requested Scope                                              | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `directory.person.r`                                         | By default, if no `BEARER_TYPE` is provided, the scope is read as a `Person` scope.              |
| `Per.directory.person.r`                                     | Same as above.                                                                                   |
| `Org.directory.machines.rw`                                  | The person can choose which organisation will be the bearer.                                     |
| `Org.warehouse.items.r`                                      | This uses a scope, that needs to be provided by `warehouse`                                      |
| `Org/b1475f65-236c-58b8-96e1-e1778b43beb7.warehouse.items.r` | This format is required for the [client credentials flow](/guide/oauth/client-credentials.html). |

::: tip IMPORTANT
When scopes are returned in `POST oauth/access_tokens`, the `BEARER_TYPE` will be always omitted. Instead a specific `bearer` will be provided that has an `id` and a `type`.

## Possible Errors

Scopes are validated and following errors can occur:

| Error identifier                    | Description                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `different_bearer_types`            | Multiple scopes were specified for different bearer types.                                                            |
| `invalid_audience`                  | The audience that was specified does not exist.                                                                       |
| `invalid_scope_name`                | The given scope name does not exist for the provided audience.                                                        |
| `invalid_scope_structure`           | The scope your provided does not match the regex as outlined above.                                                   |
| `unavailable_scope_for_bearer_type` | Some scopes are only available for `Person` or `Organization`. Usually this should be documented by the app provider. |
