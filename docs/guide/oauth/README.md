# Single Sign On & OAuth

The Connect Print platform allows for a simple single sign-on flow across all applications on the platform. In order to use the single sign-on functions, you must apply for a developer account on the platform and then create an app. After that, you can use standard OAuth flows to connect to the platform.

Currently the following OAuth flows are supported:

- [The Redirect Flow](./redirect-flow.html)
- [The Device Flow](./device-flow.html)
- [Client Credentials Flow](./client-credentials.html)
- [Access Token Refresh](./access-token-refresh.html)
