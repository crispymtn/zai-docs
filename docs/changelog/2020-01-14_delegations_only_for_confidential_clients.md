description: >
  The [Delegation access flow](/guide/oauth/delegate-access.html) only accepts access tokens to delegate that were created with OAuth confidential credentials.

  If you try to access this endpoint without an access token that was created with OAuth confidential credentials, it will return from now on a 403 (Forbidden).
